Thanks to Rosalie, for their SporeModLoader DLL that pretty much made this all possible.
Link to their github for the project - https://github.com/Rosalie241/SporeModLoader/

HELLO this is the spore mod loader for linux (SMLFL)
1 - paste your spore directory into "config.py". this will be used to manage the mods
2 - copy the contents of setup into your spore directory. if prompted, overwrite and write into.


How to install mods -
put mods into the install folder
run "runme.py"
answer any prompts, if prompted
now mods that are installed will be in the installed folder.

how to uninstall mods -
put mods from the installed folder into the uninstall folder
run "runme.py"
mods will be uninstalled and put into the uninstalled folder.
